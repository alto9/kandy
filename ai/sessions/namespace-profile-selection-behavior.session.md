## Problem Statement

namespace profile selection behavior

## Goals

To clearly define the expected behavior of namespace selection as it pertains to the namespace webview

## Approach

There should be a singular namespace webview as there is now, but there should be no namespace dropdown. The namespace profile should be populated with the currently selected namespace in the tree, and it should have a button that allows the user to set that as the current namespace in the context.

## Key Decisions



## Notes
