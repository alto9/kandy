## Problem Statement

finalize left sidebar

## Goals

Provide the full details of expected functionality of the left sidebar.

## Approach

We will be using a semi-controversial namespace-only main navigation approach. This will differentiate our plugin from the K8s one, and provide a smoother UI.

## Key Decisions

Only show cluster namespaces, with an 'All Namespaces' option at the top of each one. Clicking on a namespace will launch a new webview for viewing the namespace contents.

## Notes

If we are unable to connect to the cluster using a kubectl command, we need to exit gracefully and not keep trying. The user should refresh the connection manually.
