# Hybrid AI Architecture Decision

## Context

We need to decide how to integrate AI capabilities into Kandy while maintaining security, performance, and user experience. The AI needs access to cluster data and YAML configurations to provide intelligent recommendations.

## Decision

Implement a hybrid architecture where the VS Code extension handles UI and cluster communication, while a separate server component processes AI requests and manages LLM integration.

## Rationale

### Security Requirements
- **Cluster Data Protection**: Sensitive cluster configurations and data should not be sent directly to third-party AI services
- **Credential Management**: kubeconfig files and API credentials need secure handling
- **Audit Trail**: Need to log AI requests and responses for debugging and compliance

### Performance Considerations
- **Real-time Analysis**: Recommendations need to be responsive for good user experience
- **Resource Management**: AI processing should not impact VS Code performance
- **Caching Strategy**: Avoid redundant AI calls through intelligent caching

### Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Extension focuses on UI, server focuses on AI processing
- **Scalability**: Server can be optimized independently of extension constraints
- **Security**: Sensitive data processing happens in controlled environment
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between UI logic and AI logic

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Pure Client-side (Extension Only)
**Rejected** because:
- Security risks with sending cluster data to third-party AI services
- No control over AI prompt engineering and response formatting
- API costs not manageable from extension
- Performance impact on VS Code UI thread

### 2. Full Server Architecture
**Rejected** because:
- Extension becomes just a UI shell, losing native VS Code integration benefits
- Network latency for all operations
- More complex deployment and distribution
- Harder to provide real-time feedback for YAML editing

### 3. Direct AI Service Integration
**Rejected** because:
- Exposes sensitive cluster data to third-party services
- No control over AI prompts or response processing
- Cannot implement custom caching or optimization strategies
- Compliance and privacy concerns

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Extension** collects cluster data and user context
2. **Extension** sends structured request to **Kandy Server**
3. **Server** processes data and formats AI prompts
4. **Server** calls AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
5. **Server** processes and validates AI response
6. **Server** returns formatted recommendations to **Extension**
7. **Extension** displays recommendations in webview panels

### Component Responsibilities

#### VS Code Extension (`kandy/`)
- **UI Management**: Tree views, webview panels, user interactions
- **Cluster Communication**: kubeconfig parsing, Kubernetes API calls
- **Data Collection**: Gather cluster state and resource information
- **Recommendation Display**: Show AI insights in context

#### Kandy Server (`kandy-server/`)
- **AI Service Integration**: Manage connections to OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Create effective prompts for different analysis types
- **Response Processing**: Parse and validate AI responses
- **Caching & Optimization**: Cache responses and batch requests
- **Security**: Validate requests and sanitize responses

### Security Model
- **Data Sanitization**: Remove sensitive information before AI processing
- **Request Validation**: Validate all requests from extension
- **Response Sanitization**: Validate AI responses before returning to extension
- **Audit Logging**: Log all AI interactions for debugging and compliance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
1. Server setup with basic AI integration
2. Extension-server communication protocol
3. Simple recommendation formatting
4. Basic caching implementation

### Phase 2: Enhanced AI
1. Multiple AI providers support
2. Advanced prompt engineering
3. Real-time recommendation updates
4. Performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Custom AI models for Kubernetes analysis
2. Batch processing for complex analysis
3. Advanced caching and optimization
4. Integration with monitoring systems

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Security**: Cluster data stays in controlled environment
- **Performance**: Optimized AI calls with caching and batching
- **Control**: Custom prompts and response formatting
- **Cost Management**: Smart caching reduces API calls
- **Privacy**: No direct cluster data exposure to third parties

### Negative
- **Architecture Complexity**: Additional server component to maintain
- **Deployment Complexity**: Need to deploy and manage server component
- **Network Dependency**: Extension requires server connectivity
- **Development Overhead**: Need to maintain two separate codebases

2. Set up AI service integration in server component
3. Implement data sanitization and validation
4. Add comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
