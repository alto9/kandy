# MVP Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Core Extension Setup

### 1.1 Extension Foundation
- [ ] Set up VS Code extension project structure
- [ ] Configure TypeScript, webpack, and build pipeline
- [ ] Set up development environment and debugging
- [ ] Create basic extension manifest (package.json)

### 1.2 kubeconfig Integration
- [ ] Implement kubeconfig file parsing
- [ ] Create cluster connection management
- [ ] Add support for multiple kubeconfig contexts
- [ ] Implement cluster authentication and API client setup

### 1.3 Basic Tree View
- [ ] Implement ClusterTreeProvider class
- [ ] Create tree item hierarchy (Cluster → Namespace → Resource Type)
- [ ] Add resource grouping by API groups (workloads, network, etc.)
- [ ] Implement basic status indicators for resources

## Phase 2: Resource Display

### 2.1 Webview Panel System
- [ ] Create WebviewPanelFactory for different resource types
- [ ] Implement message passing between extension and webview
- [ ] Set up HTML/CSS/JS structure for webview panels
- [ ] Add tabbed interface for overview, YAML, events, logs

### 2.2 Pod Webview Implementation
- [ ] Display pod status, conditions, and container information
- [ ] Show resource usage and limits
- [ ] Implement basic event and log display
- [ ] Add YAML view with syntax highlighting

### 2.3 Deployment Webview Implementation
- [ ] Show deployment status and scaling information
- [ ] Display replica sets and associated pods
- [ ] Show update strategy and rollout history
- [ ] Add YAML configuration display

## Phase 3: Server Integration

### 3.1 Server Communication
- [ ] Implement HTTP client for server communication
- [ ] Set up request/response handling
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement request queuing and rate limiting

### 3.2 AI Recommendation Display
- [ ] Create UI components for AI recommendations
- [ ] Implement recommendation cards with priority indicators
- [ ] Add quick action buttons for applying suggestions
- [ ] Set up explanation tooltips and reasoning display

## Phase 4: Enhanced Features

### 4.1 Real-time Updates
- [ ] Implement Kubernetes watch API integration
- [ ] Add WebSocket support for live updates
- [ ] Set up efficient polling for resource state changes
- [ ] Handle connection failures and reconnection

### 4.2 YAML Integration
- [ ] Integrate with VS Code YAML language features
- [ ] Add YAML validation and IntelliSense
- [ ] Implement quick actions for common YAML operations
- [ ] Add AI-powered YAML suggestions

### 4.3 Problems Panel Integration
- [ ] Add AI recommendations to VS Code problems panel
- [ ] Implement quick fix providers for AI suggestions
- [ ] Set up diagnostic collection for cluster issues
- [ ] Add problem filtering and categorization

## Phase 5: Testing and Polish

### 5.1 Core Functionality Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for tree provider logic
- [ ] Integration tests for cluster API communication
- [ ] Webview panel interaction testing
- [ ] AI recommendation display and action testing

### 5.2 User Experience Polish
- [ ] Implement loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Add error handling and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Set up offline mode and cached data display
- [ ] Add accessibility features and keyboard navigation

### 5.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize tree view rendering for large clusters
- [ ] Implement efficient data caching strategies
- [ ] Add connection pooling for Kubernetes API calls
- [ ] Optimize webview panel memory usage

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (MVP Complete)
- [ ] Extension installs and activates in VS Code
- [ ] kubeconfig files are parsed and clusters displayed in tree
- [ ] Clicking resources opens appropriate webview panels
- [ ] Basic resource information displayed (status, metadata)
- [ ] YAML content shown in webview panels
- [ ] AI recommendations appear for selected resources
- [ ] Quick actions work for applying suggestions

### Should Have (Enhanced MVP)
- [ ] Real-time updates for resource status changes
- [ ] Multiple resource types supported in webview
- [ ] Problems panel integration working
- [ ] YAML editing integration with VS Code
- [ ] Search and filtering in tree view
- [ ] Performance acceptable for medium-sized clusters

### Could Have (Future Enhancement)
- [ ] Advanced AI features and custom recommendations
- [ ] Integration with monitoring systems
- [ ] Multi-cluster management features
- [ ] Advanced security and compliance checking
- [ ] Custom dashboard and visualization features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Large clusters may cause tree view slowness
  - Mitigation: Implement virtual scrolling and pagination
- **Memory Usage**: Webview panels may consume excessive memory
  - Mitigation: Proper disposal and cleanup of webviews
- **Network Issues**: Cluster connectivity problems
  - Mitigation: Offline mode and cached data display

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity**: Too many features may overwhelm users
  - Mitigation: Progressive feature rollout and user feedback
- **Learning Curve**: Users may not understand AI recommendations
  - Mitigation: Clear explanations and reasoning display

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Kubernetes API client libraries (Node.js)
- VS Code extension APIs
- AI service integration (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- HTTP client libraries for server communication

### Internal Dependencies
- kandy-server must be running for AI features
- kubeconfig file must be valid and accessible
- VS Code Kubernetes extension compatibility

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks (basic extension structure and tree view)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks (webview panels and basic resource display)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 weeks (server integration and AI recommendations)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks (real-time updates and YAML integration)
- **Phase 5**: 1-2 weeks (testing and polish)

**Total: 8-13 weeks for complete MVP**
