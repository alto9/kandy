# Storage Category Structure

## Objective

Implement the Storage category structure with 3 subcategories: Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims, and Storage Classes.

## Context

The Storage category is a container for storage-related resources. It doesn't fetch data itself but provides structure for its 3 subcategories. Each subcategory will be implemented in separate stories.

## Implementation Steps

1. Add logic to expand the Storage category into 3 subcategory tree items
2. Create tree item definitions for each subcategory type
3. Ensure subcategories appear in order: Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims, Storage Classes
4. Add appropriate icons for each subcategory
5. Make subcategories expandable (ready for future implementation)

## Files Affected

- `src/tree/categories/StorageCategory.ts` - New file for storage category
- `src/tree/TreeItemTypes.ts` - Add storage subcategory type definitions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Expanding Storage category shows exactly 3 subcategories
- [ ] Subcategories appear in correct order: Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims, Storage Classes
- [ ] Each subcategory has an appropriate icon
- [ ] Subcategories are expandable (may show empty state until implemented)
- [ ] No errors when expanding Storage category
