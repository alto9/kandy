## Objective

Implement global state management for storing user preferences, specifically the welcome screen dismissal preference.

## Context

The extension needs to persist user preferences across VS Code sessions. The welcome screen has a "Do not show this again" option that must be remembered. VS Code provides `globalState` API for this purpose.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `src/state/GlobalState.ts` class to wrap VS Code's globalState API
2. Add method `getWelcomeScreenDismissed(): boolean` to check if welcome screen was dismissed
3. Add method `setWelcomeScreenDismissed(dismissed: boolean): Promise<void>` to save preference
4. Use key "kandy.welcomeScreen.dismissed" for storage
5. Export singleton instance for use across extension
6. Add unit tests for state getter and setter methods

## Files Affected

- `src/state/GlobalState.ts` - Create global state wrapper class
- `src/extension.ts` - Initialize global state in activate()

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GlobalState class successfully wraps VS Code globalState API
- [ ] getWelcomeScreenDismissed() returns false by default for new installations
- [ ] setWelcomeScreenDismissed() persists value across extension reloads
- [ ] State key uses consistent naming convention (kandy.welcomeScreen.dismissed)
- [ ] Methods have proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Unit tests pass for state management
