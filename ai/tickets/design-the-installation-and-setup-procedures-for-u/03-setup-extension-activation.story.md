## Objective

Implement the extension activation logic and entry point with proper lifecycle management.

## Context

The activate() function is called when VS Code activates the extension. This is where we initialize all components, set up the tree view, and potentially show the welcome screen. The activation should complete within 2 seconds per the performance requirements.

## Implementation Steps

1. Implement activate() function in `src/extension.ts`
2. Initialize extension context and store globally if needed
3. Add async initialization flow
4. Register all commands that will be used by the extension
5. Set up error handling for activation failures
6. Implement deactivate() for cleanup
7. Add activation performance logging to ensure < 2 second target

## Files Affected

- `src/extension.ts` - Implement activate() and deactivate()

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] activate() function initializes successfully
- [ ] Extension context is properly stored and accessible
- [ ] Activation completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Errors during activation are caught and logged appropriately
- [ ] deactivate() properly cleans up resources
- [ ] VS Code extension host loads the extension without errors
