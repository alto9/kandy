## Objective

Apply VS Code theme-matching styles to the welcome screen for a consistent, native look and feel.

## Context

The welcome screen should match VS Code's design system and respect the user's theme choice (light/dark mode). VS Code provides CSS variables that can be used to match the theme. The design should be responsive and accessible.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create CSS file using VS Code's CSS variables for theming
2. Use variables like `--vscode-foreground`, `--vscode-background`, etc.
3. Implement responsive layout that works at different window sizes
4. Add proper spacing and typography following VS Code conventions
5. Style the checkbox and buttons to match VS Code's UI components
6. Include hover and focus states for interactive elements
7. Test in both light and dark themes
8. Ensure accessibility with proper contrast ratios

- `src/webview/welcome.html` - Add CSS styles
