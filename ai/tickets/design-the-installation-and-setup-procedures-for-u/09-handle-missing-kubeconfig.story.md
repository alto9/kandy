## Objective

Add graceful error handling for missing or empty kubeconfig files with helpful user messaging.

## Context

Not all users will have kubectl configured when they install the extension. When no kubeconfig file exists or it's empty, the extension should handle this gracefully and guide the user on how to set up Kubernetes access. The welcome screen should still appear to provide setup instructions.

## Implementation Steps

1. Add error handling in KubeconfigParser for missing file (ENOENT)
2. Add error handling for empty file
3. Create user-friendly error message explaining no clusters were detected
4. Return empty cluster list instead of throwing error
5. Create error state interface that can be displayed in tree view
6. Provide guidance on how to configure kubectl or import kubeconfig
7. Ensure welcome screen still displays with setup instructions

## Files Affected

- `src/kubernetes/KubeconfigParser.ts` - Add missing file error handling
- `src/extension.ts` - Handle empty cluster list scenario

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Missing kubeconfig file doesn't crash the extension
- [ ] Empty kubeconfig file doesn't crash the extension
- [ ] Parser returns empty array when no kubeconfig exists
- [ ] User receives helpful message explaining how to configure kubectl
- [ ] Welcome screen still appears when no kubeconfig is found
- [ ] Error is logged for debugging purposes
- [ ] Extension remains functional and can be retried after kubeconfig is added
