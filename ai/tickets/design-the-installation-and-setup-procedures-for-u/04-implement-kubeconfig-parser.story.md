## Objective

Create a kubeconfig file parser that supports both ~/.kube/config and custom KUBECONFIG environment variable locations.

## Context

The extension needs to automatically detect Kubernetes clusters configured on the user's system. The kubeconfig file is the standard configuration format for kubectl. The parser must handle the YAML structure, extract cluster and context information, and support custom file locations via the KUBECONFIG environment variable.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `src/kubernetes/KubeconfigParser.ts` class
2. Implement method to determine kubeconfig file path:
   - Check KUBECONFIG environment variable first
   - Fall back to ~/.kube/config
3. Implement YAML parsing using a YAML library (e.g., js-yaml)
4. Extract clusters array from kubeconfig
5. Extract contexts array and current-context
6. Create interface for parsed cluster data with name, server, and context info
7. Add async file reading with proper error handling
8. Return structured cluster data

## Files Affected

- `src/kubernetes/KubeconfigParser.ts` - Create parser class
- `package.json` - Add js-yaml dependency

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Parser successfully reads kubeconfig from ~/.kube/config
- [ ] Parser respects KUBECONFIG environment variable when set
- [ ] Parser extracts all configured clusters
- [ ] Parser extracts all contexts and identifies current context
- [ ] Parser returns structured, typed data
- [ ] File operations are asynchronous and non-blocking
- [ ] Parser handles valid kubeconfig files without errors
- [ ] Unit tests pass for kubeconfig parsing

## Dependencies

None (can be developed independently)
