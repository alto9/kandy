## Objective

Add error handling for invalid or corrupted kubeconfig files with clear error messages.

## Context

Kubeconfig files can become corrupted or have invalid YAML syntax. The extension must handle parsing errors gracefully without crashing. Users should receive clear feedback about the problem and suggestions for fixing it.

## Implementation Steps

1. Wrap YAML parsing in try-catch block
2. Catch YAMLException and other parsing errors
3. Create user-friendly error message indicating kubeconfig is invalid
4. Suggest checking the file for syntax errors
5. Log detailed error information for troubleshooting
6. Return empty cluster list on parse failure
7. Create error state that can be displayed in tree view with fix suggestions

## Files Affected

- `src/kubernetes/KubeconfigParser.ts` - Add YAML parsing error handling

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Invalid YAML syntax doesn't crash the extension
- [ ] Corrupted kubeconfig structure is handled gracefully
- [ ] User receives message indicating kubeconfig is invalid
- [ ] Error message suggests checking for syntax errors
- [ ] Detailed error is logged to Output channel for debugging
- [ ] Parser returns empty array on invalid file
- [ ] Extension can recover if kubeconfig is fixed and reloaded
