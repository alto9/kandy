# AI Integration Context

GIVEN we are integrating AI services for intelligent Kubernetes analysis
WHEN we need information about AI service integration
THEN refer to OpenAI API documentation at https://platform.openai.com/docs
AND use Anthropic Claude API documentation for alternative LLM providers
AND implement proper error handling and rate limiting for AI service calls

GIVEN we need to design effective prompts for Kubernetes analysis
WHEN creating prompt templates
THEN include specific context about the cluster state and resource type
AND provide clear instructions about the desired analysis type
AND format the response structure for easy parsing and display

GIVEN we need to handle AI service responses
WHEN processing LLM output
THEN parse structured responses from the AI service
AND validate that recommendations are actionable and safe
AND format responses for display in VS Code webview panels

GIVEN we need to optimize AI service usage
WHEN implementing caching and rate limiting
THEN cache frequent queries and their responses
AND implement request batching for multiple related queries
AND use appropriate AI model sizes based on complexity requirements

GIVEN we need to handle AI service failures
WHEN implementing error handling
THEN provide fallback responses when AI services are unavailable
AND implement retry logic with exponential backoff
AND log errors for debugging while protecting sensitive data

GIVEN we need to provide contextual AI recommendations
WHEN analyzing user selections and cluster state
THEN understand the relationship between YAML configurations and cluster behavior
AND correlate events, logs, and metrics for comprehensive analysis
AND provide recommendations that are specific to the selected resource type
